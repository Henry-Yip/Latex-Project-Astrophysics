# Overleaf

Overleaf is an online, collaborative LaTeX Editor. 

## Downloading the documents

Go to [the offical website of Overleaf]{https://www.overleaf.com/} and register for a new account. Create a new project and copy all the lines. Press compile and download the pdf document.

## Alternative

Download [TexMaker]{https://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/} (Alternatively, you can also use VSCode, it looks better but they are essentially the same, excepts that VSCode also supports other programming languages, like Python, etc). There are tons of tutorials in youtube, make sure to check them out.
